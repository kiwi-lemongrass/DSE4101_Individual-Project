    "One of the considerations was choosing a recursive estimation scheme over a rolling scheme in forecast estimation. While the latter is better suited for purposes like forecast comparison using DM test (which assumes that the differential is covariance stationary), the recursive estimation scheme is still favoured for practical reasons. This is because by expanding the training set timeframe, it uses more and more data to make later forecasts - parameter uncertainty is reduced, and forecast error may become less variable. Also, parameter estimation uncertainty typically constitutes a tiny fraction of forecast error variance, so reducing it would not noticeably violate stationarity. "
